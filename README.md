<h1 align="center">Welcome to my Github.</h1>

👋🏿 As a kid, I was always a ‘tinkerer.’ When toys or appliances were broken, I loved to take them apart and see if I could fix them. My curiosity for how things are built, led me to pursue a career in Software Engineering.  I want to build software that has a positive impact, and makes our lives more efficient, creative, active and enjoyable! 

I have experience in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, web and iOS/Android development, building APIs, managing databases (Postgres, DynamoDB), and utilizing AWS cloud services.
